# Advertising-Campaign-Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing social media advertising campaigns to evaluate their performance and effectiveness. By leveraging a real-world dataset containing ad impressions, clicks, conversions, and costs, this analysis uncovers key insights about the audience, campaign ROI, and factors driving success.

Project Overview:
The project provides insights into audience segmentation, campaign performance, and ROI evaluation. The analysis involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the application of key performance indicators (KPIs) to evaluate ad campaign success.

Key Insights:
Audience Segmentation Analysis:
Identifies the most responsive age groups, gender, and interests, enabling more effective targeting.
Campaign Performance Evaluation:
Assesses the Click-Through Rate (CTR), Cost per Click (CPC), and Cost per Conversion (CPC) to determine the efficiency of different ad campaigns.
ROI Analysis:
Calculates the Return on Investment (ROI) for each campaign to determine profitability and the overall success of ad spend.

Key Features:
Data pre-processing and cleaning of raw advertising data.
Exploration of audience data (age, gender, interests).
Analysis of campaign performance (CTR, CPC, Cost per Conversion).
ROI evaluation to assess campaign profitability.
Visualization of insights using plots and charts for easy interpretation.
