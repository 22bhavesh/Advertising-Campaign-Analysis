# Ad Campaign Performance Analysis

## Project Background
This project focuses on the performance evaluation of digital ad campaigns for an online marketing company. The goal is to optimize future campaigns by analyzing audience segmentation, campaign performance, and ROI.

## Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

- Audience Segmentation Analysis
- Campaign Performance Evaluation
- ROI Analysis

The Python scripts used for data analysis can be found in the repository.

## Data Structure & Initial Checks

The dataset consists of the following key fields:

- Campaign ID: Unique identifier for each campaign.
- Age Group: Age range of the audience targeted.
- Gender: Male/Female.
- Impressions: Number of times the ad was shown.
- Clicks: Number of times the ad was clicked.
- Conversions: Number of successful actions (e.g., purchases).
- Cost: Total cost of running the campaign.
- Revenue: Total revenue generated by the campaign.

## Initial Checks Performed

Data quality verification, including missing values and outlier detection.

Data type validation for numerical and categorical fields.

Summary statistics for initial insights.

## Recommendations
Based on the findings, the following recommendations are proposed:

- Audience Targeting: Prioritize the 30-34 age group and interest category 31 for cost-effective conversions.

- Campaign Optimization: Refine campaigns targeting females to improve conversion efficiency.

- Budget Allocation: Allocate higher budgets to campaigns like 916 and 936 that demonstrate high ROI and cost-efficiency.

- Performance Monitoring: Continuously monitor ROI and cost-per-conversion metrics to adjust strategies in real-time.

## Assumptions and Caveats

- Missing values in gender were imputed using the mode.

- Outliers in cost data were excluded to prevent skewed insights.

- Data is assumed to represent the entire campaign period accurately.

This project was conducted using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The code and detailed analysis can be accessed in the accompanying Jupyter Notebook file.
